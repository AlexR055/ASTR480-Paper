    Reduce a raw science frame by performing bias subtraction, dark subtraction,

    Parameters:
    - science_filename: path to the raw science FITS file
    - median_bias_filename: path to the median-combined bias frame
    - median_flat_filename: path to the median-combined and normalized flat frame
    - median_dark_filename: path to the median-combined dark frame (in units of e‚Åª/sec)
